            Ever since I was in high school, I have had an obsession with
            creating unique and next-generation experiences for others. As an
            award winning frontend developer, I have made it my career&apos;s
            mission to develop responsive, accessible, and memorable products
            for whoever I get the pleasure to work with. I love finding areas to
            optimize things or make a process simpler. I&apos;m a team player,
            translator for the non-techies, and motivated worker.
